abstract: for decades, the world has been through different financial crises and different events for example, housing crises, brexit vote etc. there have been a lot of events affecting the world's ecnomony and all these would be lead to affecting peoples salary income. to understand the living standards of the past, i used a linear regression to do an analysis on how the wages in 1985 was affected what affected them. \

# 1 Introduction
The Current Population Survey is a statistical survey that is jointly sponsored by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the U.S. Census Bureau (Census) on a monthly basis. It is the primary source for U.S. labor force statistics. The survey includes a representative sample of about 60,000 homes and focuses on those individuals who are 15 years and older to make an inferential assumption about the U.S. population as a whole.\

the data i have selected today is the data from May 1985. i have decided to pick a month in the middle of the year since jobs are mostly stable and without the start and end of year bonuses, the wages in the middle month of the year would better and a more accurate estimation of peoples income.\

the CPS is a very important survey as the information gathered are from individuals of all demographics and used to estimate the unemployment rate of the country. The information gathered every month and analyzed on is to ensure the wellbeing of people living in the US, as the government would be able to implement different policies and react to sudden changes of the living qualities of citizens.\

though during COVid-19 the response rate of the survey has decreased to 69.9% in april 2020, the data we are using today is from 1985 which has a response rate of up to 90% back in the days.\

the dataset would provide valuable insights. the model would indicate the factors affect the wages of people in 1985 and . the paper would first provide an overview of the dataset i have collected and the variables relevant to the study i would want to conduct. the method of data collection would also be stated and given a run through. next, the methodology section would discuss the pros and cons of the linear regression model i would be using. i would also address how the weaknesses can be further improved and make the study more all rounded. the results section would then display my findings on the models and graphs i have used in the process, with explaining the interpretation of concepts in my results. finally, the discussion section would include subsections of my findings, ethics, limitations and improvements.\

# 2 Data 
This report, including all necessary data cleaning, analysis and visualization, was produced with the R
statistical programming language (R Core Team 2020) in the R Markdown file format. It uses features
from several packages. The dataset is accessed through the CPR dataset. The tidyverse package is used for data cleaning and manipulation (Wickham et al. 2019), as well as janitor (Firke 2021). Tables and graphs are generated with kableExtra (Zhu 2020), modelsummary (Arel-Bundock 2021), patchwork (Pedersen 2020), and ggplot2 (Wickham 2016). A map iscreated with ggmap (Kahle and Wickham 2013), osmdata (Padgham et al. 2017) and sf (Pebesma 2018).External data is accessed, imported, and exported with RCurl (Temple Lang 2021), readxl (Wickham and Bryan 2019), xml2 (Wickham, Hester, and Ooms 2020). The models are assessed with performance (Lüdecke et al. 2021). To facilitate a reproducible workflow, here (Müller 2020) is used to reference file locations, knitr (Xie 2021) to format the report into a PDF style.\

the way to recruit respondents and answers to surveys are not specified and that we have assumed it to be randomly sampled.\

The dataset contains 547 observations taken from the CPS with 11 variables of the wages, education, experience, age, ethnicity, region, gender, occupation, sector, union and married. the variables are a good representation of the living of people as income is one of the more direct ways of testing the living conditions of citizens.\

one thing to notice is that we need to understand shortcomings of the survey, one of which is the source didnt state the number of peoples approached. we only know that there are 547 respondents in this dataset. This means that we would not be able to calculate and estimate the effects of response bias to this paper. Second thing to note is that the income stated as hourly wages doesnt specify whether the amount is before tax, after tax, including side business or only job salary. this would be a slight factor that may lead to instability of the linear regression model. However, since the respondents are taken randomly, we can still assume there wouldnt be a big bias on the paper.the dataset doesnt include options for respondents to not answer to the questions such as answers like dont know, do not wish to responds. therefore, in the dataset, there werent any responses that needed to removed nor cancelled. 

# 3 Variables
Some key variables to note is that wages is calculated in dollars per hour.\

Religion would only include whether the person lives in the south of otherwise.\

Experience is only a rough estimation using the formula of age - education - 6.\

in constructing our model, we have decided to take out several variables and use 2 key variables as our predictor variable which is age and education.\

# 4 Methodology
since this paper aims to find the factors affecting income, we have decided to use a linear regression model to showcase our findings. \

the model assumes the wages as the response variable.\


# 5 Results
```{r}

plot(x = CPS1985_1_$education,y = CPS1985_1_$wage,
   xlab = "education",
   ylab = "wage",
   main = "Weight vs Milage")
plot(x = CPS1985_1_$age,y = CPS1985_1_$wage,
   xlab = "age",
   ylab = "wage",
   main = "Weight vs Milage"
)
plot1 <- lm(CPS1985_1_$education~CPS1985_1_$wage)
